        For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were features like floats and positioning. These work, but in some ways they're also limiting and frustrating.

    </p>
    <p>
        The following simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools in any kind of convenient, flexible way:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</li>
        <li>Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.</li>
        <li>Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.</li>
    </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Introduction">
    <header>Introduction</header>
    <p>In this article, you'll work through a series of exercises to help you understand how flexbox works. To get started, you should make a local copy of the first starter file —  <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox0.html">flexbox0.html</a> from our github repo. Load it in a modern browser (like Firefox or Chrome) and have a look at the code in your code editor. You can also </p>
    <code>
        section {
        display: flex;
        }
        Copy to Clipboard
    </code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="The_Flex_Model">
    <header>The Flex Model</header>
    <p>
        When elements are laid out as flex items, they are laid out along two axes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The main axis is the axis running in the direction the flex items are laid out in (for example, as rows across the page, or columns down the page.) The start and end of this axis are called the main start and main end.
        </li>
        <li>The cross axis is the axis running perpendicular to the direction the flex items are laid out in. The start and end of this axis are called the cross start and cross end.</li>
        <li>The parent element that has display: flex set on it (the &lt;section&gt; in our example) is called the flex container.</li>
        <li>The items laid out as flexible boxes inside the flex container are called flex items (the <article> elements in our example).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bear this terminology in mind as you go through subsequent sections. You can always refer back to it if you get confused about any of the terms being used.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Columns_or_rows?">
    <header>Columns or rows?</header>
    <p>Flexbox provides a property called flex-direction that specifies which direction the main axis runs (which direction the flexbox children are laid out in). By default this is set to row, which causes them to be laid out in a row in the direction your browser's default language works in (left to right, in the case of an English browser).</p>
    <p>Try adding the following declaration to your &lt;section&gt; rule:</p>
    <code>
        flex-direction: column;
    </code>
    <p>You'll see that this puts the items back in a column layout, much like they were before we added any CSS. Before you move on, delete this declaration from your example.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Wrapping">
    <header>Wrapping</header>
    <p>One issue that arises when you have a fixed width or height in your layout is that eventually your flexbox children will overflow their container, breaking the layout. Have a look at our <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox-wrap0.html">flexbox-wrap0.html</a> example and <a href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/css-layout/flexbox/flexbox-wrap0.html">try viewing it live</a> </p>
    <p>Here we see that the children are indeed breaking out of their container. One way in which you can fix this is to add the following declaration to your &lt;section&gt; rule:</p>
    <code>flex-wrap: wrap;</code>
    <p>Also, add the following declaration to your <article> rule:</p>
    <code>flex: 200px;</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Horizontal_and_vertical_alignment">
    <header>Horizontal and vertical alignment</header>
    <p>You can also use flexbox features to align flex items along the main or cross axis. Let's explore this by looking at a new example: <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/css-layout/flexbox/flex-align0.html">flex-align0.html</a> <a href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/css-layout/flexbox/flex-align0.html">(see it live also).</a> We're going to turn this into a neat, flexible button/toolbar. At the moment you'll see a horizontal menu bar with some buttons jammed into the top left-hand corner.</p>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox-example5.png" alt="flexbox">
    <p>First, take a local copy of this example.</p>
    <p>Now, add the following to the bottom of the example's CSS:</p>
    <code>
        div {
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: space-around;
        }
    </code>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox_center_space-around.png" alt="alignment using flexbox">
    <p>align-items controls where the flex items sit on the cross axis.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>By default, the value is stretch, which stretches all flex items to fill the parent in the direction of the cross axis. If the parent doesn't have a fixed width in the cross axis direction, then all flex items will become as long as the longest flex item. This is how our first example had columns of equal height by default.
        </li>
        <li>The center value that we used in our above code causes the items to maintain their intrinsic dimensions, but be centered along the cross axis. This is why our current example's buttons are centered vertically.</li>
        <li>You can also have values like flex-start and flex-end, which will align all items at the start and end of the cross axis respectively. See align-items for the full details.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can override the align-items behavior for individual flex items by applying the align-self property to them. For example, try adding the following to your CSS:</p>
    <code>
        button:first-child {
        align-self: flex-end;
        }
    </code>
    <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox/flexbox_first-child_flex-end.png" alt="override styles using flex">
    <p>justify-content controls where the flex items sit on the main axis.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The default value is flex-start, which makes all the items sit at the start of the main axis.</li>
        <li>You can use flex-end to make them sit at the end.</li>
        <li>center is also a value for justify-content. It'll make the flex items sit in the center of the main axis.</li>
        <li>The value we've used above, space-around, is useful — it distributes all the items evenly along the main axis with a bit of space left at either end.</li>
        <li>There is another value, space-between, which is very similar to space-around except that it doesn't leave any space at either end.</li>
    </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="Nested_flex_boxes">
    <header>Nested flex boxes</header>
    <p>It's possible to create some pretty complex layouts with flexbox. It's perfectly ok to set a flex item to also be a flex container, so that its children are also laid out like flexible boxes. Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/css-layout/flexbox/complex-flexbox.html"> complex-flexbox.html </a> <a href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/css/css-layout/flexbox/complex-flexbox.html"> (see it live also) </a>.</p>
    <p>The HTML for this is fairly simple. We've got a &lt;section&gt; element containing three &lt;article&gt;s. The third &lt;article&gt; contains three &lt;div&gt;s. :</p>
    <code>
        section - article
        article
        article - div - button
        div   button
        div   button
        button
        button
    </code>
    <p>Let's look at the code we've used for the layout.
        <br> First of all, we set the children of the to be laid out as flexible boxes.</p>

    <code>
        section {
        display: flex;
        }
    </code>
    <p>
        Next, we set some flex values on the &lt;article&gt;s themselves. Take special note of the 2nd rule here: we're setting the third &lt;article&gt; to have its children laid out like flex items too, but this time we're laying them out like a column.
    </p>
    <code>
        article {
        flex: 1 200px;
        }

        article:nth-of-type(3) {
        flex: 3 200px;
        display: flex;
        flex-flow: column;
        }
    </code>
    <p>
        Next, we select the first &lt;div&gt;. We first use flex:1 100px; to effectively give it a minimum height of 100px, then we set its children (the &lt;button&gt; elements) to also be laid out like flex items. Here we lay them out in a wrapping row and align them in the center of the available space as we did with the individual button example we saw earlier.
    </p>
    <code>
        article:nth-of-type(3) div:first-child {
        flex:1 100px;
        display: flex;
        flex-flow: row wrap;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: space-around;
        }
        Copy to Clipboard

    </code>
    <p>
        Finally, we set some sizing on the button. This time by giving it a flex value of 1 auto. This has a very interesting effect, which you'll see if you try resizing your browser window width. The buttons will take up as much space as they can. As many will fit on a line as is comfortable; beyond that, they'll drop to a new line.


    </p>
    <code>
        button {
        flex: 1 auto;
        margin: 5px;
        font-size: 18px;
        line-height: 1.5;
        }
    </code>

        <header>Summary</header>
        <p>That concludes our tour of the basics of flexbox. We hope you had fun and will have a good play around with it as you proceed further with your learning. Next, we'll have a look at another important aspect of CSS layouts: CSS Grids.</p>
